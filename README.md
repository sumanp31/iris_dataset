# iris_dataset
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda &amp; Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

A description on files in this repository:
1. data_vis.py : Data visulaization. Part 1 visualises how the different attributes of the different categories vary. Part 2 is the scatter plot of length vs width with every category ploted in different colour.
